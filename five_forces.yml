competitor_rivalry: > 
 Rivalry between existing competitors in short-haul aviation,
 with low-cost airlines is also extremely high, this is because major 
 short-hall flight operators like SkyJet and FlySwift already operate 100 
 plus destinations across Europe. Ultimately that indicates a “war” amongst
 the organisations on who can invite more customers to their business. An initial 
 way of being competitive is by offering edge to edge prices to customers as well as
 having successful marketing campaign. For instance, FlySwift added a new goodie bag
 for customers in their new marketing commercial, which increased their sales by 22.87% 
 for July, however because of this Skyjet and WizAir lost almost 10% of their sales in
 that month. Since the price was not much different customers and as people had 
 the choice of different airlines (FF – Threat of Substitute). Although, if one
 organisation does a strategy like this, it is possible for other companies to 
 retaliate appropriately. For August, WizAir offered a new loyalty program
 which gave their loss a new profit of 5.3%, which later decreased FlySwifts
 campaign for that month.  For new entrants like KVM, their capture of the market
 share would be more difficult as other companies will also focus on 1 to 1 innovation
 within their product or service, and as those companies have a much higher
 brand identity more customers are likely going to pick them. 

# Write your assessment of the threat of new entrants.
new_entrant_threat: >   
  The threat of new entrants for KVM Airlines, which operates
  short-haul flights as well as following a low-cost sector,
  is incredibly high. This is because airlines like Skyjet
  and Flyswift has established a well-renowned reputation
  in front of customers who use the service frequently or
  for holidays. For KVM entering a market such as the aviation
  industry (solely focusing on short haul flights), requires
  them overcoming massive barriers such as high startup costs
  (Maintenances, airport slots), aviation licences, safety
  standards, and compliance with the EU regulations. However,
  that is just the beginning, they still must construct a
  strong customer base which brings cost up substantially.
  KVM can influence the market by establishing competitive
  prices, improving the customer experience, or focusing on
  underdeveloped routes. However, well-established competitors
  such as Skyjet and Flyswift already have loyal clients and
  vast networks, making it difficult for new entrants to
  immediately achieve a major market share. To counter the
  competing challenges, KVM will need to provide a convincing
  value proposition and unique identities (such as innovation)
  to bring a “spark” within their product and service, one example
  of this could be: a more flourished customer experience at the
  airport

# Write your assessment of the threat of substitute products or services.
substitute_threat: >
  The threat of substitutes for KVM or any airline in the short-hall aviation
  market is highly aggressive. For instance, if other airlines offer significant
  rewards or perks (as mentioned in the force above), customers have the option
  to choose the most convenient choice of airline. However, this force doesn't
  only impact a significant airline but also the market itself. How does this
  impact the short-hall market? Well, new modes of transport can heavily decrease
  the share. Currently, trips to Paris and surrounding countries have decreased
  from air travel as the Eurotunnel made its move for passengers. Such things are
  going to initiate more within the future, as the UK government sees opportunities
  to connect the country with a train straight to New York (even though it's not a
  short hall impact it still can cause more countries to develop it to save carbon emissions).
  Major airlines know about this and will prepare a solution to the problem in hand,
  One-way Skyjet improved this was with implementing a scheme where people can buy a
  group ticket for “more less than ever”. The ease of switching between providers and
  the availability of alternatives increase the threat of substitution, making it more
  difficult for a new entrant like KVM to establish a foothold in the market.

# Write your assessment of the bargaining power of customers.  
customer_power: >
  In the short-haul aviation market, the bargaining power of customers
  is high because of the low prices airlines offer. With many airlines
  competing for sales and reducing their price tags on travel, customers 
  can compare and choose the best choice (FF – Threat of Substitutes). Additionally, 
  loyalty programs and point advantages give customers a better ability
  to make informed decisions. Currently, travel agents and holiday
  organizations include flight options for customers, which bundle the 
  flight with the price of their holiday. In the eyes of customers, this
  makes them feel more appreciated and welcomed. Not only this, but since
  the aviation market itself restricts airlines from increasing prices
  (amid economic changes) due to competitive rivalry, customers tend to use
  short-haul travel for more of their holidays. Airline organisations use 
  innovation to attract customers. For example, WizAir implemented a discount 
  on children’s tickets, which, in the eyes of customers, was a perfect solution 
  for better and cheaper travel. For a new entrant like KVM, they should focus more 
  on how to meet customer needs and wants and how they can implement this in their
  business. Better seat comfort or a private lounge can be a good option for KVM to use.
  Customers tend to like things which have better quality and does not cost them much more.
  In a long-term approach, it can strengthen the Airlines share in the market. 

# Write your assessment of the bargaining power of suppliers.
supplier_power: >
  Due of the shortage of suppliers for vital services such as
  aircraft, fuel, and airport facilities, suppliers in the
  short-haul aviation market can have significant bargaining
  strength. Airlines are frequently reliant on a few large
  aircraft suppliers, such as Boeing and Airbus, limiting
  their ability to negotiate reduced rates or change suppliers
  quickly. Similarly, fuel providers hold considerable leverage,
  as the cost of aviation fuel can account for a big amount of
  an airline's operating expenses (costs more on short-haul
  flights). With shifting worldwide fuel prices, airlines have
  limited control over this expense. Furthermore, airports, which
  are frequently owned by a few major corporations, can charge
  hefty fees for landing and terminal services. Since short-haul
  aircrafts are used more regularly, it's possible that the cost
  of Maintenances will increase, and the aircrafts must also be
  safe to fly. FlyShift must Maintenances each aircraft every
  month. For KVM, supplier costs could cut profits and even
  proportion of market share. Some suppliers may benefit more
  to certain airlines because of their certainty.

# Write your conclusion regarding the appropriate competitive strategy to pursue, based on
# your assessments above.
competitive_strategy: >
  Based on the analysis of the five forces, KVM airlines can face
  many challenges in the competitive short-haul aviation market, this
  is indicated from the massive rivalries between existing organisations,
  the bargaining powers of customers and suppliers, and the threat of
  substitutes. However, as there are challenges there are also ways to
  succeed, for instance KVM must follow the different strategies. They
  need to have a successful marketing campaign so more people can see
  what the business offers and how it is unique compared to other companies
  like FlySwift and Skyjet. With this they also need to follow a proper
  customer service experience, such as better seat quality, better travel,
  perks and lounges. Supplier costs will always be a massive issue, since
  they are limited number of suppliers, so KVM must spend rationally to
  still get the best quality. The market will thrive on the more customers
  it would get, and competitors' rivalry will expand and give room for
  appropriate and healthy competition. However, the threat of substitutes
  can impact the entire market, forcing airlines to adapt, with that the
  organisation must produce enough environmental changes (low emission
  aircrafts) and perks for customers to entirely choose them. KVM can also
  succeed if they also implement a cost leadership. What this means that if
  they become one of the cheapest but most reliable airline, it gives them
  better accumulative feedback overall.
